# Recipe Roulette (UX Project)

Recipe Roulette solves your conundrum about what to make for dinner!

The primary goal of this app was to get acquainted with the step-by-step process of designing an app after the research phase has concluded. It was the culmination of a class <!--get details--> on Udemy. There are multiple UI issues to fix (see Issues). It was a good opportunity to put into practice things like typeface choices, interface options, as well as go through the process from paper wireframes to this final project.

<!-- eventually embed actual prototype, or at very least gif of it in action. -->
